* Final Report
* Final Presentation Slides
* Final Presentation Video
## Introduction 
Our final project utilizes the open flight dataset to construct a graph of airport vertices. Djikstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path betweentwo airports, a Page Rank algorithm is used to find important airports, and BFS will be used to traverse through our airport graph. 
## File description(code and data)
* All classes are located in the src folder
* Airport Class: the Airport class is used for defining the vertices of our graph structure. Each airport is constructed with a name, latitude, and longitude coordinates. Data is retrieved from (airport.dat)
* airport_graph : This is our graphs class that supports the creation and insertion of vertices and edges
* BFS : Implementation of a BFS graph traversal
* Djikstras : Implementation of Djikstra's algorithm to find shortest path
* PageRank : Implementation of the Page Rank algorithm
