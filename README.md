Introduction
Our final project uses OpenFlights airports and routes data to construct a graph of airport vertices. Djikstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two airports, a Landmark Path algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two airports with landmarks in between, and a Page Rank algorithm is used to find important airports.
